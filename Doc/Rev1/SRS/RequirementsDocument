This document describes the requirements for the \href{https://github.com/skyostil/fretsonfire}{\term{Frets on Fire}} project created by Unreal Voodoo.  The template for the \term[SRS]{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)} is a subset of the Volere\cite{volere}.
\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to recreate the main functionality of the \term[Game]{video game}, \term{Frets on Fire}, by following the software development process midst providing proper detailed documentation. Additionally, we will be programming the \term[Game]{game} in a modern language, C\#, improving on the outdated graphics, as well as providing meaningful test cases using Unity Test Framework.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients of this \term[Project]{project} is the instructor of SFWRENG 3XA3, Dr. Ashgar Bokhari, and the teaching assistants (TAs) of the course, Mohammed Mirajkar and \textcolor{red}{\sout{Maryan} Maryam} Hosseinkord. As the clients, they will provide instructions on what deliverables need to be completed, offer assistance wherever possible, and evaluate the degree to which the \term[Project]{project} meets the requirements outlined in the \term{SRS}.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of this \term[Project]{project} are any individuals who are interested in playing \term{Frets on Fire} or an open source game similar to \term{Guitar Hero} on \term{PC}. The \term[Project]{project} does not target a specific demographic and is available for the general public who have the hardware and software requirements to download and play. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Group 16 members, are considered stakeholders of the \term[Project]{project} as their skills are necessary in the development of the \term[Project]{project}, including responsibilities such as implementing, testing and documenting the \term[Project]{project}, and they are interested in the success of the \term[Project]{project}. In addition, The developers of the \term{Frets on Fire}, Unreal Voodoo, and Github Users who have forked the \term{Frets on Fire} repository are also stakeholders as they wish to seek improvements of the \term[Game]{game} and, like Group 16 members, are interest in the success of it.

The use case diagram above shows the various way a user can interact with our application. As starting a game track involves the gameplay itself, it has lots of included use cases. The other uses cases such as view instructions, open settings menu, and view leaderboard are self-explanatory. The user can also access these 3 use cases using the pause menu, and that is shown using the extend relationship.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
There are no open issues on \term{Frets on Fire}'s official repository. The last commit was made in 2014.

The version of the game installed with the downloadable installer crashes immediately upon launching. Furthermore, the open-source repository requires an old version of \term{Python}, as well as slight code modifications, to compile.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\term{Frets on Fire} is the only notable open-source \term{Guitar Hero}-type game. \term{Clone Hero} is the best-known and most complete game of this genre on \term{PC}, but its source code is not public. Clone Hero contains many of the advantages \term{Rhythm Master} is intended to have over Frets on Fire, namely improved visuals and ease of installation on modern PCs.

Outside of Frets on Fire, there is not much code specific to this type of game to reference in the creation of Rhythm Master. Most adapted code, should any be used, will originate from Frets on Fire.

\subsection{New Problems}
Game performance must be a focus of the development team in order to maintain responsive gameplay. It is unknown how complicated replicating \term{Python} code behaviour in \term[C Sharp]{C\#} will be.

\subsection{Tasks}
\label{subsec:Tasks}
Tasks are scheduled and delegated as per the project \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/palanicv/3xa3__l01_gr16_project/-/blob/master/ProjectSchedule/Group16Gantt.pdf}{\color{blue}Gantt Chart}.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A. \term{Rhythm Master} will work independently of \term{Frets on Fire}.

\subsection{Risks}
There is minimal risk with this type of project, because it is intended to run as a standalone program with little to no interaction with external systems. Risks originating from the program itself include excessive resource usage, unexpected crashes, and poor performance. In order to minimize these risks, the program should be tested on multiple hardware configurations of varying levels of performance.

\subsection{Costs}
This project will not have any monetary cost, because it will use open-source development software and resources. Time cost is estimated to be approximately $\hyperlink{time_cost}{TIME\_COST}$ hours of development and testing.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{Documentation}
Player instructions will be included as an option in the game's main menu. These instructions will highlight the game's control scheme, and the logic behind scoring.

The game's directory will contain a README file, providing installation instructions.

\subsubsection{Training}
No specific training is necessary to play \term{Rhythm Master}. Controls should be intuitive, and practice should only be needed to improve player skill.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
\noindent Low priority additions, given extra development time, include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Importing custom-made \term[Game track]{game tracks}, from within the game.
    \item Display resolution and graphics quality controls.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
