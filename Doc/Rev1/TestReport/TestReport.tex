}
\newpage
\subsection{Performance}

To test if the test case NFR-5-PE1 where the system should maintain a fps of $\hyperlink{fps}{MIN\_FRAMERATE}$ during gameplay, a fps tracker was used to track the fps of the game, and that data was then graphed which can be found in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fps.png}
\caption{Framerate of game during a game track playthrough} \label{fig:frdynamic}
\end{figure}

The tests were run using the systems specified in the table below.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Systems used in performance testing} \label{tab:systems}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{5cm}X}
\toprule {\bf System} & {\bf Hardware}\\
\midrule
Medium performance & i7 8550U @ 2.4 GHz\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The test is considered successful as the system has been able to maintain frame-rates above the $\hyperlink{fps}{MIN\_FRAMERATE}$  during gameplay.

\testmanual{
    name = {NFR-10-PE4},
    desc = {Test that the system can store atleast $\hyperlink{min_user_score_saves_test}{MIN\_USER\_SCORE\_SAVES\_TEST}$ user scores. Test was carried out using automated script where 
$\hypertarget{min_user_score_saves_test}{MIN\_USER\_SCORE\_SAVES\_TEST}$ scores were saved, and checked whether all scores still existed},
    type = {Automated},
    user = {Testing group},
    pass = {All scores still persists},
    result = \textcolor{Green}{PASSED}
}

	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

In the original implementation, Frets on Fire, there were 18 test cases that tested for each component without referencing any documentation that would aid in the traceability of the test cases to functional and non-functional requirements. The test cases were not thorough as it did not test for all components of the system and it lacked testing for non-functional requirements. With Rhythm Master, the development team wrote a software requirements specification, test plan document, and design documentation to aid in the traceability to requirements and modules. Moreover, this document also serves as a way to keep track of all the tests that were done and to provide The team considered and used a variety of different testing including specification testing, functional testing, and exploratory testing and completed a total of 50 test cases prior to the final demonstration of the project.

\section{Unit Testing}
Unit testing was only used to test individual components of modules because of the highly interconnected nature of video games such as Rhythm Master. The numerous modules of the project must be correct in their interactions with each other, and it was too costly to conduct unit testing on each one to confirm correct behaviour. Large, experience-based projects such as this are better served via manual and exploratory testing, in order to ascertain correct user experiences.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
Formal testing did not reveal any necessary changes in terms of module interfacing, decomposition, or internal design. Changes made to code were to address bugs and logical errors revealed by the testing plan. In terms of the gameplay experience, graphical improvements were made throughout the development process in response to feedback from developers and informal testers.

\section{Automated Testing}
Automated testing was only a minimal part of testing due to the fact that the software being tested is a game which is GUI based. The testing of the software required user inputs and exploration of various scenarios in the game. However, unit tests that test each game component's functionality was automated using Unity Test Framework,
